# Toronto Streetscore: Predicting Perceived Street Safety Using CNN

This project aims to build an explainable machine learning model that could predict people's perceived safety toward streets views.

We apply deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) techniques on street view images fetched using Google Street View API.
